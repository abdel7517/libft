Libft (Library of Functions)

In this project, you will be creating a library of functions, the file structure for this project is the following:

.c Files
Where all of your functions will be written in.

.h (Header)
Your header file is useful for 2 things:

First, instead of doing for example #include <unistd.h> in all of your .c files, you just write it once in your header and all of your .c files will read it from your header file.
Secondly, let's say one of your .c files uses another function from another .c file, well instead of writting that function above, just write #include "libft.h" and it will find it in your header file.
Make sure you add #include "libft.h" in all of your .c files.

Makefile
Makefile is where you will create a file to compile your projects. Remember how in the piscine, you created an int main and gcc to compile the projects, well with a Makefile, you don't have to do that anymore, you just type make once you have created your Makefile.
